# Bluro

**Bluro** is a headless content management (CMS) system that was built with a clear goal to
achieve - build something interesting and learn useful skills. As a part of the project a blog "Tech
Overload" was build.

Backend uses **no express** and **no sequelize or other ORMs** only bare bones, only hardcore

Frontend on the other hand make use of **React and bunch of other dependencies** to simplify
development

### Start

To start bluro cms you need to provide some config parameters. You can do it ether by passing into
config.json in the root of the bluro_cms directory or by specifying environment variable. I'd
recommend set sensitive data as an environment variable.

Environment variables:

-   secret - string that will be used to generate and validate JWT (JS Website Tokens)
